# Asmetal2java
Asmetal2java is a tool that automatically generates a Java file from an Abstract State Machine (ASM) specification written in Asmeta. 
This allows developers and researchers to quickly convert ASM models into Java code,
facilitating the integration of formal specifications into software development processes.
